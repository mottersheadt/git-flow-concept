# VGS Git Flow Example

This example demonstrates how to keep your VGS Vaults in Sync using Github Actions.

In order to follow this demo you can create a free VGS account at https://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com.

Note - This example requires you to use the [VGS CLI](https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/vgs-cli/getting-started/) and [provision a service account](https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/vgs-cli/service-account/) for interacting with your Vaults. You must store the values of your service account client ID and secret as encrypted secrets within your Github Actions repository. In this example they are stored using the values `VGS_CLIENT_ID` and `VGS_CLIENT_SECRET`.
